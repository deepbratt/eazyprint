					   <h3 style="text-align:left;"> Taxes
                      </h3>
					   <p style="text-align:left;">The purchase of a Eazyprint shirt has two components - the purchase price for the shirt, and the amount that is donated to the campaign at the end of the campaign. Whether the donation amount is tax deductible as a charitable contribution depends upon the cause itself. Some of the campaigns on our site are run by recognized 501(c)(3) organizations, but many are not. If you have questions about the deductibility of the donation portion of your purchase, or a stand-alone donation made on our site, contact your tax advisor.
                      </p>
					 
					  <h3 style="text-align:left;"> Transmission of funds to seller
                      </h3>
						<p style="text-align:left;">All funds due to the Seller will be paid by Eazyprint to the Seller, via the contact and account information submitted by the Seller. You must create a PayPal account using this same contact information so that we can send you the funds via PayPal. We also reserve the right to require that Sellers provide us with a Form W9 to designate a tax ID number for the individual or entity receiving funds from a successful campaign. You agree that if we send payment to you in the correct amount Eazyprint's obligation will be satisfied. You agree that you have verified your contact information, to make sure that payments from Eazyprint are able to reach you.
						</p>

						<h3 style="text-align:left;"> Risk of fraud or potential misdirection of funds
						</h3>
						<p style="text-align:left;">DUE TO THE RISK OF FRAUD OR POTENTIAL MISDIRECTION OF FUNDS, EAZYPRINT WILL NOT PROCESS OR HONOR CHANGE OF ADDRESS OR CHANGE OF ACCOUNT REQUESTS ONCE A CAMPAIGN BEGINS. AS A SELLER, PRODUCT PURCHASER, DONOR, OR THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY, YOU AGREE THAT ANY AMOUNTS OF MONEY THAT ARE UNPAYABLE TO THE SELLER ACCORDING TO EAZYPRINT'S PROCESSES IN THESE TERMS WILL BE REDUCED BY EAZYPRINT'S COSTS OF ATTEMPTING TO MAKE PAYMENT ACCORDING TO THESE TERMS, WITH THE REMAINDER TO BE PAID TO A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION WHICH, IN EAZYPRINT'S SOLE DISCRETION, IS ALIGNED WITH THE GENERAL PURPOSE OR SUBJECT MATTER OF THE CAMPAIGN.
						</p>

						<h3 style="text-align:left;"> Unclaimed funds
						</h3>
						<p style="text-align:left;">Eazyprint makes every effort to transmit funds due each Seller. In cases where the Seller fails to submit sufficient account information (PayPal account details, tax information if applicable, current mailing address, correct email address, etc.), Eazyprint will make a good faith effort to contact the Seller and/or Beneficiary in order to render a payment in accordance with Eazyprint's processes. If Eazyprint is unable to contact the Seller and/or Beneficiary and retrieve sufficient payment information after a period of six months from the campaign's end date, Eazyprint may then deem the funds unpayable, and disperse the funds to a charitable organization of Eazyprint's choosing.
